This HTML document is a simple user interface for manipulating registers and a stack in the context of assembly language programming. It includes input fields for registers (AX, BX, CX, DX), a selection menu for choosing registers, and buttons for various operations like MOV, XCHG, and stack-related instructions (POP, PUSH). The script handles the logic for these operations, allowing users to move values between registers, exchange values, and perform stack-related actions.
